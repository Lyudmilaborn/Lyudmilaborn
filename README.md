- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lyudmilaborn
- 👀 I’m interested in web design and programming in general. In addition, I am a creative person, I am engaged in music. That's why I'm interested in creating something new and connecting the sphere of music and IT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming. Although I study this at university, but I myself understand that I know very little.
- 💞️ I look forward to working with the same energetic and interested people.
